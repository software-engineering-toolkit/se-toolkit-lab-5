# Dashboard Front-end

<h4>Time</h4>

~45 min

<h4>Purpose</h4>

Add charts to the front-end to visualize the analytics data from Task 2, and learn to integrate a chart library into a React application.

<h4>Context</h4>

The analytics endpoints are returning data. Now the team wants a visual dashboard so users can see score distributions, submission timelines, and group performance at a glance.

You will use `Chart.js` (via `react-chartjs-2`) to create bar charts, line charts, or tables.
An AI coding agent can help with the `Chart.js` integration.

## 1. Steps

### 1.1. Follow the `Git workflow`

Follow the [`Git workflow`](../../../wiki/git-workflow.md) to complete this task.

### 1.2. Create a `Lab Task` issue

Title: `[Task] Dashboard Front-end`

### 1.3. Install the chart library

1. To navigate to the front-end directory,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](../../../wiki/vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   cd frontend
   ```

2. To install `Chart.js` and the React wrapper,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](../../../wiki/vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
   ```

3. Go back to the project root:

   ```terminal
   cd ..
   ```

### 1.4. Create the dashboard component

> [!NOTE]
> The dashboard should display at least two of the following visualizations:
>
> - **Bar chart** — score distribution from `/analytics/scores`
> - **Line chart** — submissions over time from `/analytics/timeline`
> - **Table** — pass rates from `/analytics/pass-rates` or group performance from `/analytics/groups`
>
> You can use an AI agent to generate the `Chart.js` integration code.

1. Open the [coding agent](../../../wiki/coding-agents.md#what-is-a-coding-agent) in the `frontend/` directory.
2. Give it a prompt like:

   > "Create a Dashboard component in `frontend/src/Dashboard.tsx` that:
   > 1. Fetches data from `/analytics/scores?lab=lab-04`, `/analytics/timeline?lab=lab-04`, and `/analytics/pass-rates?lab=lab-04` using the Bearer token from localStorage (key: `api_key`).
   > 2. Shows a bar chart of score buckets using `react-chartjs-2`.
   > 3. Shows a line chart of submissions per day.
   > 4. Shows a table of pass rates per task.
   > 5. Includes a dropdown to select different labs."

3. Review the generated code. Make sure it:

   - Imports from `react-chartjs-2` and registers `Chart.js` components.
   - Reads the API token from `localStorage` (key: `api_key`) for the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
   - Renders at least one `<canvas>` element (this is how `Chart.js` renders charts).
   - Handles loading and error states.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to implement manually, here is the minimal setup for a bar chart:
>
> ```tsx
> import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2'
> import { Chart as ChartJS, CategoryScale, LinearScale, BarElement, Title, Tooltip } from 'chart.js'
>
> ChartJS.register(CategoryScale, LinearScale, BarElement, Title, Tooltip)
> ```
>
> Then render `<Bar data={chartData} />` where `chartData` has the `Chart.js` data format.

### 1.5. Add navigation

1. Update `frontend/src/App.tsx` to include navigation between the Items page and the Dashboard.

   You can use an AI agent or implement it manually. A simple approach:

   - Add a state variable for the current page (e.g., `"items"` or `"dashboard"`).
   - Add buttons or links in the header to switch between pages.
   - Render the Items table or the Dashboard component based on the current page.

### 1.6. Verify locally

1. To navigate to the front-end directory,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](../../../wiki/vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Configure the environment. Complete these steps:

   1. Open the file [`frontend/.env.example`](../../../frontend/.env.example) ([how to open a file](../../../wiki/vs-code.md#open-the-file)).
   2. Copy it to `frontend/.env`.
   3. Set `VITE_API_TARGET` to the URL of your back-end API, for example `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:<caddy-port>`.

      Replace:

      - [`<your-vm-ip-address>`](../../../wiki/vm.md#your-vm-ip-address)
      - [`<caddy-port>`](../../../wiki/caddy.md#caddy-port)

3. To install dependencies and start the dev server,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](../../../wiki/vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   npm install && npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the URL shown in the terminal output in a browser.
5. Connect with your API key.
6. Navigate to the Dashboard page.

   You should see charts rendering with data from the analytics endpoints.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure you have run `POST /pipeline/sync` at least once (from Task 1)
   > so there is data for the analytics endpoints to return.

### 1.7. Deploy to the VM

1. [Connect to your VM](../../../wiki/vm.md#connect-to-the-vm).
2. To deploy the updated front-end,

   [run in the `VS Code Terminal`](../../../wiki/vs-code.md#run-a-command-in-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   cd se-toolkit-lab-5
   git fetch origin && git checkout <task-branch> && git pull
   docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret up --build caddy -d
   ```

   Replace [`<task-branch>`](../../../wiki/git-workflow.md#task-branch).

3. Open in a browser: `http://<your-vm-ip-address>:<caddy-port>`.

   Replace:

   - [`<your-vm-ip-address>`](../../../wiki/vm.md#your-vm-ip-address)
   - [`<caddy-port>`](../../../wiki/caddy.md#caddy-port)

   Connect with your API key and verify the Dashboard page shows charts.

   <details><summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

   <h4>Charts do not render</h4>

   Open the browser developer tools console and check for errors. Common issues: missing `Chart.js` component registration, incorrect data format, API returning errors.

   <h4>Container build fails</h4>

   Check that `frontend/package.json` includes `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` in dependencies (not devDependencies).

   </details>

### 1.8. Commit your work

1. [Commit](../../../wiki/git-workflow.md#commit) your changes.

   Use this commit message:

   ```text
   feat: add analytics dashboard with charts
   ```

### 1.9. Finish the task

1. [Create a PR](../../../wiki/git-workflow.md#create-a-pr-to-the-main-branch-in-your-fork) with your changes.
2. [Get a PR review](../../../wiki/git-workflow.md#get-a-pr-review) and complete the subsequent steps in the `Git workflow`.
