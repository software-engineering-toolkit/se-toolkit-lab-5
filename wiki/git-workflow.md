The following diagram shows this workflow in the context of repositories:

## Create a `Lab Task` issue

[Create an issue](./github.md#create-an-issue) using the `Lab Task` [issue form](./github.md#issue-form).

## Switch to the `main` branch

[Switch to the `main` branch](./git-vscode.md#switch-to-the-branch) in `VS Code`.

## Detect conflicts

[Detect conflicts with the `origin/main`](./git-vscode.md#detect-conflicts).

## Pull changes from `main` on `origin`

[Pull changes](./git-vscode.md#pull-changes-from-the-branch-on-remote) from `main` on [`origin`](./github.md#origin).

## Pull changes from `main` on `upstream`

[Pull changes](./git-vscode.md#pull-changes-from-the-branch-on-remote) from `main` on [`upstream`](./github.md#upstream) to get the latest fixes from the instructors' repository.

## Switch to a new branch

[Create a new branch and switch to it](./git-vscode.md#switch-to-a-new-branch).

### `<task-branch>`

We'll refer to the [new branch](#switch-to-a-new-branch) as `<task-branch>`.

## Edit files

[Edit files](./vs-code.md#editor) using `VS Code` to produce changes.

## Commit

[Commit changes](./git-vscode.md#commit-changes) to the [`<task-branch>`](#task-branch) to complete the task.

## (Optional) Undo commits

[Undo commits](./git-vscode.md#undo-commits) if necessary.

## Publish the branch

[Publish the branch](./git-vscode.md#publish-the-branch) with your changes.

## Push more commits

[Push more commits](./git-vscode.md#push-more-commits) to the published branch if necessary.

## Create a PR to the `main` branch in your fork

[Create a PR](./github.md#create-a-pull-request-in-your-fork) from the branch [`<task-branch>`](#task-branch) to `main`. Replace:

- `<repo-name>` with `se-toolkit-lab-<N>` where `<N>` is the number of the lab.
- `<branch>` with `<task-branch>`.
- [`<repo-owner-github-username>`] is `inno-se-toolkit`.
- [`<your-github-username>`](./github.md#your-github-username) is your `GitHub` username.

## Get a PR review

[Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator (see [PR review rules](#pr-review-rules)).

Get the collaborator's comments and address them, e.g., make fixes or ask to clarify the comment.

Get the collaborator to approve the PR.
